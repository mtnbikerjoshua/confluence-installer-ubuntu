# confluence-installer-ubuntu
This script is intended to install confluence on Ubuntu along with a working database.

I created this script to install confluence on my own server, but I intend to make it more versatile.

To download and run this installer from ubuntu run the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/mtnbikerjoshua/confluence-installer-ubuntu.git

cd confluence-installer-ubuntu

chmod 555 confluence-installer-ubuntu.sh

./confluence-installer-ubuntu.sh
